Michael Archer,"About time excel got with the picture. But first thing I tried was a use in power query, sadly this seems not yet ready for prime time.  DataFormat.Error: Invalid cell value '#VALUE!'. What a shame, gI uess need to wait to join all my data. (tears in the eyes). But appreciate the heads up on this feature it will be a game changer for dull lifless tables full of SKU's or partnumbers when the world is a visual beast."
onewhitewolf13,Was this a phased release? My images are showing as text 'Picture'. Anyone else have this issue? :(
Md. Mahmudul Alam Symon,"Wow!!
Thanks a lot for sharing these nice tricks!"
An,This is super helpful and useful as well! Thank you!
Eyal Siryon,"@LeilaGharani , I have kind of a challenge for you. I need to present on my pivot chart the filter that was picked. I do not want users to start looking through the filter to figure out that the output is currently showing the information for Q1 this year for example."
kn4golf,"As always, great presentation 🙂 Works for me in the Table itself, but not in the Pivot afterwords 😞 ?"
Walter f,Thanks for the class.  Can the same be done with States of the United States?
Future Commentary,When will it be available to general 365 users?
Emstedt,Love that you can now insert pictures into cells but I'd love it even more if it would be possible to dynamically get them from the web via a link referenced somewhere else in the file. This would open up so many possiblities for me.
WR الوثائقية,"Awesome 👏. I have a question. Can I create a flow using power automate to check my emails for data requests sent to teams, extract, and list them in an excel sheet. The idea is to create a tracker sheet to track requests, dates requested and received. Is that possible or it’s a wild idea? Thanks in advance."
Silver Villacacan,can you make videos how to run macros in protected sheets?
Ray Medina,"Hi Leila, love the show! Thank you for all the wonderful tips.. I'm writing because I,'ve noticed that lately my pivot tables won't give a row total but it will give me a column total. I've try it from scratch, toggling the ON for rows and columns and nothing. I've even opened a Microsoft support ticket and nobody can tell me why. Could you help?"
Guilherme Lira,"In my Excel, I can find the Data > Data Types and find country-related information. The step I am stuck in is the part that goes on Insert > Picture > ""Place in Cell"", the latter option simply doesn't exist in my Excel version. Does anyone know what can be the reason and how to activate it? Thanks in advance! :)"
mustafa çelik,"Dear Leila, Thank you for vid. It is amazing. I am office 365 user but I dont have ""place in cell"" feature in insert /picture tab. I have all updates. What can you suggest me to fix it ?

FIDA HUSSAIN,"AOA
copy a data from filtered cells, where after filtering few cells are hide. when I paste it in another place. it will only paste first few cells which are in series till the hide cell. 
for example if I had data in 10 rows. when I apply filter data of 1,2, 3, 6, 8,10 is visible. while 4,5,7 and 8 will be hidden. while I copy the visible cells and try to paste then only 1, 2 and cell 3 data is pasted while all other is not pasted. plz suggest any trick in the excel to resolve this issue."

Moker_020,"I truly like all these ideas and suggestions from Leila, but I constantly run into issues when applying them in to a large corporate environment. Linking data via SharePoint gives enough trouble. But pivoting tables and images across multiple data sources and servers (SharePoint, which which are accessibly to everyone within the target audience)  always gives an error message like: ""This is not possible"". Makes me feel like being back in 1998, which is also worth something."
mrjaydp123,"Hi. Im hoping if you can help pls. Having issues with conditional format

A1 = NOW(). example result 11:00
B1 = 7:00. On time format
Conditiinal format formula is highlight if a1 > b1.

May i ask why its not highlighting when the statement is true?"

I have a csv file on excel and I have half-yearly data.
I want to have only yearly data so would you say I should cancel all the first half of the year data and keep the last one, or should I do like a merging of the two semesters?"
Ana D. (Iferana Morgana),This is amazing!!!
Ken McMillan,Brilliant!! I wish MS would hurry up and add these features to my 365!!

Ηλιας Μπαλ,"I have an excel file that I use for work, specifically car parks. The data I use are the following, license plate number, time of entry, time of exit, duration of stay, and based on these the price is calculated.
Sometimes I mistakenly click on the classification, as a result of which the numbers get confused, i.e. they get mixed up.  If I don't understand it right away to reverse it with undo, what options do I have?"
Nader Mounir,Very nice video 📹 with bramd new informstion
sully 72,i like power query  but i feel the more data you have the quicker it would be to do it with formulas and creating everything yourself. especially with data sets that continually increase such as if you're tracking multiple KPI's for each month and adding all the data to an annual folder. I don't know if that can be helped though.
Vardan Sharma,I lav ya
Miguel rdabbott,your example is so cluttered and keeps me from wanting to implement this.
Tristan Geoffroy,"Thank you so much! I'm going to use this right away; great tutorial. However, I've noticed that when I add the flag field to pivot table, it displays ""image of country name..."" instead of the actual country flag image. Did I overlook a setting or option? Or it isn't yet GA for now?"
Eran T.,Great additions to Excel
Shashi Ranjan,"Hi Leila, Is there a way to export or Link these table with custom formatting and images to PowerPoint? I Know it can be done as Image or entire workbook can be embedded but both are not desirable."
